- Files include version information and last updated timestamps in headers

[2025-04-30] – Divergence: series_spider.py
- Refactored `series_spider.py` beyond original checklist
- Fully modular structure with clean methods per field

[2025-04-30] – episodes_spider.py Enhancements
- Added `_load_unprocessed_episodes_from_db()` method
- Implemented database query for `shows` table, loads episode URLs from the `seasons` JSON
- Filters out episodes already present in the `episodes` table
- Ensures full scraping coverage

[2025-04-30] – Workflow Update
- Updated scraper flow: Run `series_spider.py` first to gather show + episode URLs, then run `episodes_spider.py`
- Keeps spiders isolated in concern but fully integrated in workflow

[2025-04-28] – farsiland_scraper/spiders/episodes_spider.py (v5.0.3 → v6.0.0)
- Complete refactor into a modular, clean, and maintainable architecture
- Extracted logic into focused methods
- Improved error handling and fallback logic
- Integrated with the upgraded `VideoLinkResolver` module
- Added support for direct MP4 links
- Improved detection reliability for season/episode/title
- Fixed item limiting to respect `max_items` parameter

[2025-04-27] – Major Pipeline Refactor: JSONSerializationPipeline
- Rewrote pipeline for structured validation and separation of concerns
- Created item-type detection and field-level validation logic
- Introduced strict processing for `video_files` with schema enforcement
- Converted loose numeric/string inputs to correct types
- Added structured error handling with context-aware messages
- Prevented database failure from malformed items

[2025-04-25] – farsiland_scraper/utils/sitemap_parser.py (v3.0.0 → v4.0.0)
- Simplified codebase from ~600 lines to ~400 lines
- Modularized using `RequestManager` and `SitemapParser` classes
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
- Normalized URLs to prevent duplication

- Fixed file handle leaks in error cases with proper 'with' statements
- Removed forced DEBUG log level
- Added file locking for cache access using filelock library
- Made timeout and retry parameters configurable from config
